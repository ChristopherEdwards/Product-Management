This file contains Supply Items and Order Units used in matching uploaded
Prime Vendor invoice data.
 
The user inputs the name of a supply item and the item's corresponding
Vendor Stock Number (VSN). When an item is uploaded from the vendor, the
Drug Accountability software attempts to identify the item by the NDC.
If a match cannot be found, the entries in this file will be checked.
By storing the supply items, the user does not have to identify the item
on the invoice as a supply item each time it is uploaded. 
 
The Prime Vendor ships drugs in a variety of order unit sizes. In some
instances, the order unit on a invoiced item does not match the order 
unit in the facility's files. When this occurs the user has to perform a 
manual match on the item.
 
By entering the order unit sent by the Prime Vendor to the order unit in
VISTA, the matching can be performed automatically during the upload 
process.
