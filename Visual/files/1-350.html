DO NOT delete entries in this file.  DO NOT edit data in this file with
VA File Manager.
 
Entries in this file are created by other applications calling approved
application specific routines.  This file is the link between Accounts
Receivable and an application.  Integrated billing will attempt to
aggregate charges where possible to reduce the number of account 
entries necessary.  Resolution of charges from Accounts Receivable would
then be accomplished through Integrated Billing.
 
Entries in this file will not be deleted or edited (except for the
status field, cancellation reasons filed, last updated field, and
user last updating field).  Rather than deleting an entry, an entry
is "reversed" by creating an additional entry with the IB ACTION TYPE
entry that cancels the original entry.  An entry is edited by creating
the cancellation entry and then adding an updated new entry.  All entries
related to the original entry will be related by the PARENT LINK field.
 
There is also an IB ACTION type that is an event, which may include
Hospital admissions, NHCU admissions, and outpatient visits.  All of
the charges associated with an event will be related to that event by
the EVENT LINK field.
 
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
