<td><pre>
The Transmission Batch File contains individual batches of orders with
pointers to all orders that have been grouped in that batch for
transmission to the DDC. The file contains information specific to each
batch, such as the status of the batch and the pointer to the transmission
message. This is a dynamic file whose entries are deleted as part of the
purge process when all orders in the batch are no longer active.
 
When a transmission batch is closed, all information needed by the DDC for
each order is gathered and stored in the Transmission Batch File in the
exact format that is sent in the mail message to the DDC. This information
is stored in the "H" node of the file which is a non-standard node. The
"H" node has been made non-standard in order to conserve space in the
transmission message.
 
Data definitions for this file are distributed with the ROES. No data is
distributed.
