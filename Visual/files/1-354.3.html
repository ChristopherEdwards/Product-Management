This file contains the threshold amounts for the Medication Copayment
Income Exemption.
The Medication Copayment Income Exemption legislation
was effective on 30-Oct-92.  The thresholds are normally effective
on December 1.  To simplify implementation VACO has determined that
the threshold effective 1-Dec-92 would be used for the period from 30-Oct-92
to 1-Dec-92.
 
The Medication Copayment Income Exemption from 1992 thru 11/30/96 was
based on veterans making less than the VBA rate for pension plus Aid
and Attendence.
 
With the filing of the 1996 thresholds,  the directive was changed to
reflect that the Medication Copayment Income Exemption was to be based on
veterans making less than the VBA rate for Basic Pension.  This is the
directive that is still in effect for current rates.
 
 
 
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
