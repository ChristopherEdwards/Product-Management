<td><pre>
Deletes the entry as an entry in TIU Document Definition file 8925.1.
Entry will first be deleted as an item wherever it is used as an item.
Entries In Use by documents cannot be deleted.  An entry must have Status
Inactive before it can be deleted to ensure that it is not used during the
delete process.  Only the owner can delete an entry.  National entries
and Shared Components cannot be deleted.
 
If the entry is pointed to by by an entry in another file (for example if
an entry has a Business Rule which references it), it is the user's
responsibility to delete the entry which points to it (for example, the
Business Rule) before deleting the entry.
 
OBJECT DELETE
Objects can be deleted only from the Detailed Display of the object.
Action deletes the object from the file.  Objects can be deleted only by
the owner and only after being inactivated.  Objects cannot be deleted if
they are embedded in boilerplate text of any entries.
