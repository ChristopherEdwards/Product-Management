This file serves as the log of emergency department visits.  It works 
together with the ED LOG HISTORY file to track when activities of a
typical emergency department visit are done.  It records where the patient
went, who was responsible, and when key things happened (such as triage
and disposition).
 
This file serves as the key source of information for data that is
displayed on the emergency department display board (an electronic "white
board").  Patient visits that are currently active are shown on the
display board.  The display board is refreshed every 30 seconds.  Many of
the indexes in this file assist in making the refresh code as efficient as
possible.
