<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This file defines the resolution statuses that may be related to a
finding.  National resolution statuses are distributed in this file, but
sites may create local resolution statuses.  If local resolutions are
defined, they must be mapped to a national resolution status.  The
national resolution statuses are used by the process that creates dialog
sentences for finding items.  
 
The distributed national resolution statuses may not be deleted. 
 
Most of the findings from files can be automatically analyzed and
associated with a resolution status.  For example, Education topics
entered for a current visit are "DONE AT ENCOUNTER", Education topics
entered for a historical visit are "DONE ELSEWHERE", Education topics with
a Level of Understanding of Refused are "PATIENT REFUSED" resolutions. The
health factor is a file of findings that we cannot categorize without the
sites telling us what the related resolution status should be.
 
The statuses will be used in the future for roll-up counts to reflect how
reminders were resolved (done, historical, refused, contraindicated,
ordered).
